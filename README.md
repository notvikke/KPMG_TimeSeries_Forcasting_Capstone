Introduction & Problem Context

This capstone project aims to address the critical issue of demand forecasting inefficiency within ACME TEXTILE, a specialised company engaged in the production and sale of clothing for service professionals across various sectors. Currently, the demand forecasting process heavily relies on subjective assessments made by sales representatives, who predict the end-client product demand for the subsequent two months based on their experience and customer knowledge. However, the accuracy of these forecasts has notably declined due to the ever-changing market dynamics experienced throughout 2022.

The inadequacy of the existing forecasting method, which lacks adaptability to volatile market conditions, has resulted in significant error rates, subsequently leading to substantial financial inefficiencies. This is primarily manifested through overproduction or inadequate stock levels, causing undue strain on the company's production and inventory management processes. Consequently, ACME TEXTILE has suffered substantial losses and encountered cash flow challenges.

To mitigate these challenges and enable data-driven decision-making, a robust analytical model must be developed. The primary objective of this capstone project is to leverage historical sales data, including relevant data from the past years to enhance the accuracy of demand forecasts. The model will provide predictions for the subsequent two months, aiming to minimise the disparity between predicted and actual sales figures. By achieving greater precision in forecasting, the model will facilitate optimised production planning, efficient inventory management, and cost savings across the entire supply chain.
